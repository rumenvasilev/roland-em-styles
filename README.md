# roland-em-styles
A collection of Balkan music styles for Roland EM series keyboard arrangers ([EM2000](https://www.roland.com/global/products/em-2000/), EM50)

They should work on the old G-series as well, in case that's what you have.

For many years I kept this collection in a very old mailbox. That service will soon shutdown, which is why I'm moving these files here.

## How to use them

Copy whichever [styles](Styles/) you want to a floppy disk, insert into your keyboard arranger's floppy drive, load and you're good to go :)

## Credits

I got most of these styles in the early 2000s from a music shop in Plovdiv, Bulgaria - Bozov.
